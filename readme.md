## Who is this library for?

This library is for me; Kris. Nice to meet you. You are absolutely free to use it or any part of it as you see fit, but it is not meant for you and whatever you do is obviously at your own risk.

## What is inside this library?

This library contains mostly low level utility stuff that I keep needing in my hobby projects. This includes types an functions for dealing with text, email addresses and more of that sort of thing.

## What framework is this for?

This library is just plain old typescript and I'm trying to be framework agnostic here. I'm using Angular myself though and some bias will likely slip in.

## I have a problem with something in here, where do I get support?

Feel free to [raise your issue on github](https://github.com/theredhead/ts-foundation/issues).
